> At Hopkins and in academia in general, each cohort of epi students reinvents the wheel         
By contrast, in silicon valley, and the tech industry, each cohort inherits software and platforms from their predecessors           
[Cumulative advancements](https://abikesa.github.io/why-python/) are self-evident in their products, sales, revenues, and global reach       
This is something we should aspire to
