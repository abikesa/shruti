# 2 Elevator Pitch

**"Revolutionizing Epidemiology with PAIRS: A Dynamic, Collaborative Platform"**

Dr. Mehta, imagine an epidemiology department where cutting-edge, dynamic tools are at the heart of research and education. Our current reliance on commercial software like Stata, while effective, limits accessibility and collaboration due to cost barriers. It's time for a disruptive change that leverages the best of open-source technology.

I propose the PAIRS platform—Python, Artificial Intelligence, R, and Stata—integrated into a seamless, collaborative environment using Jupyter Books and GitHub. This approach offers several advantages:

1. **Accessibility and Cost-Effectiveness:** By transitioning to open-source tools like R and Python, we make powerful statistical analysis accessible to everyone, regardless of budget constraints.

2. **Dynamic Learning and Research:** Jupyter Books hosted on GitHub allow for continuous updates, interactive learning, and real-time collaboration. This transforms static documents into living, breathing resources.

3. **Enhanced Collaboration:** GitHub's robust platform for version control and collaboration is already the standard in the tech world. Adopting this in epidemiology will foster easier sharing of scripts, data, and findings, enhancing teamwork and innovation.

4. **Future-Proofing Our Department:** By embracing these modern tools, we position our department at the forefront of educational and research innovation, ensuring we maintain our top-rated status and attract the best minds.

**Incorporating Absolute Risks into the Curriculum:**

In addition to the PAIRS platform, we must shift our curriculum's focus from merely identifying risk factors through multivariable regression to understanding and communicating absolute risks. Absolute risks provide a more holistic view by considering the combined effect of multiple risk factors on an individual, which is crucial for informing public health policy and clinical decision-making.

To facilitate this, I propose integrating interactive web apps into our curriculum. These apps, built using HTML and JavaScript, allow students to calculate and visualize absolute risks. I've already developed a platform that embeds such apps within Jupyter Books, combining the strengths of Python, R, Stata, and JavaScript.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Personalized Learning:** Students will develop and embed interactive apps within their Jupyter Books, enhancing their ability to communicate complex data intuitively.
- **Hands-On Experience:** By working with real-world data and creating tools that can directly impact public health and clinical practice, students gain practical, actionable skills.
- **Innovative Teaching:** Leveraging tools like chatGPT for code generation and modification, students can quickly adapt and enhance their apps, ensuring they stay at the cutting edge of technology and science.

Let's lead the charge in transforming how epidemiology is taught and researched, making our department a beacon of dynamic, inclusive, and cutting-edge science. I'd love the opportunity to spearhead this initiative and work with you to make this vision a reality."
